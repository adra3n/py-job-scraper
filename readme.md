   - Navigate to the project directory.
   - Run the script by executing: `python job_scraper.py`
   - Follow the prompts to enter the location (e.g., Istanbul), country code (e.g., tr), and job title (e.g., developer).

3. **Output**:
   - The script will display job listings with details such as title, company, location, and metadata.

## Example

Suppose you want to find developer jobs in Istanbul (Turkey). Run the script, provide the necessary inputs, and it will fetch relevant job listings from Indeed.
